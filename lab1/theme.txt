* They are the Kings of the Nightworld. Those looming unseen in the gloomy betweens.
	They are the bringers of darkness which cut the throats of the weak as they sleep.

* The looming night falls upon the meek and frail turning them into horrible abominations.
	Creatures from folklore, they hunt you down.
